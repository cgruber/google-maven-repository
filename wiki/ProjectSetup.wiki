Released versions of Google maven projects are now available in the [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ central maven repository] so it is not necessary to reference another repository directly.

SNAPSHOT versions of Google maven projects may be obtained from Google's snapshot repository. Add the following snippet to your pom.xml to reference that repository.

{{{
<repository>
  <id>google-maven-snapshot-repository</id>
  <name>Google Maven Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/google-snapshots/</url>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository>
